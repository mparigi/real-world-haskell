These are programs written while working through "Real World Haskell" by Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen.
The book is available at http://book.realworldhaskell.org/.

I didn't do all of the exercises, and don't have all the files/code talked about in the book. I did what I felt was necessary for practice.
